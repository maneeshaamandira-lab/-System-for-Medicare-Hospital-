🏥 System for Medicare Hospital

The **System for Medicare Hospital** is a Java-based GUI application developed for the module **SE 1307 - Programming 02** as part of the BSc (Hons) in Software Engineering program.
This system is designed to manage hospital operations including patient registration, appointment scheduling, medical records management, billing, and administrative functions.
The application emphasizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and file handling techniques.

🎯 Features

- 🔐 Secure Login System (Admin)
- 👤 Patient Registration
- 📅 Appointment Scheduling
- 🩺 Doctor Management
- 📄 Medical Record Management
- 💳 Billing and Payment Processing
- 💾 File Handling (Data saved and retrieved from files)
- 🖥️ User-Friendly GUI

🧱 Object-Oriented Concepts Used

The system was developed using core OOP principles:

- **Abstraction** – Implemented using abstract classes such as `Person` and `MedicalStaff`.
- **Inheritance** – Classes like `Patient`, `Doctor`, and `Administrator` inherit from base classes.
- **Encapsulation** – Private attributes with public getters and setters.
- **Polymorphism** – Method overriding (e.g., `performDuties()` in subclasses).
- **Classes & Objects** – Structured system design using multiple classes.

🛠 Technologies Used

- Java
- Java Swing (GUI)
- File Handling (Text Files)
- Apache NetBeans IDE 23

🔑 Login Credentials (Demo)

For demonstration purposes:
